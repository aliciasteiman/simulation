Hours Spent:

### Primary Roles
We have largely been pair programming for this project so far. We split up the simulations to each write two models.

### Resources Used


### Running the Program

Main class: 
- Main.java

Data files needed: 
- All configuration files for the various simulations under the data
folder. 
- The properties files as well as the styling for the simulations can be found under resources.

Features implemented:
- Simulations for:
    - Game of Life
    - Percolation
    - Rock Paper Scissors
    - Segregation
    - Spreading of Fire
    - WaTor
- UI interactions to select simulation type and configuration
- Starting, saving, stepping, speeding up and slowing down simulations
- Changing the simulation type
